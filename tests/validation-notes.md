# Validation Notes

`tests/validate-package.sh` performs local checks that do not require internet access:

- JSON syntax
- manifest-to-disk skill/reference integrity
- `AGENTS.md` required reference alignment
- shared risk-level reference usage across skills
- required skill metadata fields
- subagent skill preload presence, syntax, uniqueness, manifest registration, and primary-skill alignment
- negative subagent frontmatter regression fixtures for malformed, duplicate, empty, unknown, and unterminated skill lists
- subagent runtime limits, least-privilege tool policy, critical denials, rationales, and handoff contract
- source-to-installed Nori subagent semantic comparison fixtures
- non-skeletal templates
- slash command template references
- safety sections in command-heavy references
- Bash syntax and helper `--help` smoke tests
- basic permission hygiene
- PowerShell parser validation when `pwsh` or `powershell` is installed
- nori.json schema validation via `tests/validate-schema.py`
- CI workflow validation via `tests/validate-ci-workflows.sh`

`tests/validate-schema.py` performs structural validation of `nori.json`:

- required top-level fields (`name`, `version`, `type`, `description`, `author`, `license`, `skills`, `references`)
- root package type fixed to `skillset`
- semver version format (X.Y.Z)
- no TBD placeholders in `repository`, `homepage`, or `bugs.url`
- unique skills, references, and tags (no duplicates)
- every skill has a directory and `SKILL.md`
- every reference file exists on disk

`tests/validate-ci-workflows.sh` validates CI workflow quality:

- every workflow must declare top-level `permissions:`
- no `ubuntu-latest` floating tag (must pin to `ubuntu-24.04`)
- push/PR-triggered workflows must use `concurrency:` groups
- checkout actions must be pinned by commit hash, not just major version tag

`tests/validate-links.sh` is optional and requires internet access plus `curl`. It treats 2xx, 3xx, 401, and 403 as reachable because vendor documentation sometimes blocks anonymous HEAD requests.

PowerShell syntax was not validated in environments where no PowerShell runtime is present. Run:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File tests/validate-powershell-syntax.ps1
```

## Live validation note - 2026-07-08

External links were validated through web retrieval because local curl-based validation could not resolve external DNS in the packaging container. See `tests/reports/live-validation-2026-07-08.md`.

PowerShell parser validation with `pwsh`/`powershell` was not possible in this environment. The package still includes `tests/validate-powershell-syntax.ps1` for validation on a host with PowerShell installed.

## Live subagent runtime smoke test

Run only in an isolated Linux or WSL environment with Linux Node.js 22 or newer, Bubblewrap (`bwrap`), Claude Code, Nori, and operator-configured model credentials:

```bash
bash tests/live-subagent-runtime-smoke.sh
```

The test records observed versions but does not require fixed Claude Code, Nori, or model versions. It creates an isolated temporary Claude home, installs the local worktree through Nori, validates the installed subagents, and runs synthetic analytical, executor, handoff, and delegated hard-cutoff probes.

Every model process runs with a minimal environment inside a Bubblewrap mount namespace that exposes the temporary tree and required read-only system runtime paths, not the operator workspace or home. A temporary fail-closed `PreToolUse` hook allows only the exact synthetic `printf` commands; every other Bash input is denied.
Model transport still requires network access, but the guarded Bash tool cannot issue a network command. The test never targets production
infrastructure.

Exit `2` means a prerequisite is blocked, not that validation passed. Transcripts contain model output and remain temporary and untracked unless the operator explicitly passes `--keep-artifacts`. Authentication values are imported from the existing Claude Code settings without being printed or copied into the retained artifacts.

The parser can be validated without model/API consumption:

```bash
bash tests/live-subagent-runtime-smoke.sh --self-test
```
