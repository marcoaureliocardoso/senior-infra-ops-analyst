# Validation Notes

`tests/validate-package.sh` performs local checks that do not require internet access:

- JSON syntax
- manifest-to-disk skill/reference integrity
- `AGENTS.md` required reference alignment
- shared risk-level reference usage across skills
- required skill metadata fields
- subagent skill preload presence, syntax, uniqueness, manifest registration, and primary-skill alignment
- negative subagent frontmatter regression fixtures for malformed, duplicate, empty, unknown, and unterminated skill lists
- non-skeletal templates
- slash command template references
- safety sections in command-heavy references
- Bash syntax and helper `--help` smoke tests
- basic permission hygiene
- PowerShell parser validation when `pwsh` or `powershell` is installed
- nori.json schema validation via `tests/validate-schema.py`
- CI workflow validation via `tests/validate-ci-workflows.sh`

`tests/validate-schema.py` performs structural validation of `nori.json`:

- required top-level fields (`name`, `version`, `description`, `author`, `license`, `skills`, `references`)
- semver version format (X.Y.Z)
- no TBD placeholders in `repository`, `homepage`, or `bugs.url`
- unique skills, references, and tags (no duplicates)
- every skill has a directory and `SKILL.md`
- every reference file exists on disk

`tests/validate-ci-workflows.sh` validates CI workflow quality:

- every workflow must declare top-level `permissions:`
- no `ubuntu-latest` floating tag (must pin to `ubuntu-24.04`)
- push/PR-triggered workflows must use `concurrency:` groups
- checkout actions must be pinned by commit hash, not just major version tag

`tests/validate-links.sh` is optional and requires internet access plus `curl`. It treats 2xx, 3xx, 401, and 403 as reachable because vendor documentation sometimes blocks anonymous HEAD requests.

PowerShell syntax was not validated in environments where no PowerShell runtime is present. Run:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File tests/validate-powershell-syntax.ps1
```

## Live validation note - 2026-07-08

External links were validated through web retrieval because local curl-based validation could not resolve external DNS in the packaging container. See `tests/reports/live-validation-2026-07-08.md`.

PowerShell parser validation with `pwsh`/`powershell` was not possible in this environment. The package still includes `tests/validate-powershell-syntax.ps1` for validation on a host with PowerShell installed.
